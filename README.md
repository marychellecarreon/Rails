# Welcome to Rails
  This is my first project using Rails (Creating the Blog Application)

### Overview
  This is a simple guide on how to use Rails covering the basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller).
  It will also help to quickly generate starting pieces of Rails application.
  
### Getting Started
  Please visit http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.9/getting_started.html on how I've done this blog application.
  
  
### Others
 To make this blog application looks presentable, I applied Bootstrap and CSS for the layout.
